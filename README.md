# Ubuntu stuff

Things and scripts that come in handy when re-installing ubuntu/linux


## How to

```shell
# run the bulk of it
git clone <this repo>
sudo setup.sh

# diff the bash RC for nice git brach viz, and other important install stuff
```

## Overview
* ```.bashrc```: mods of bashrc with practical aliases, changes to get pretty git in terminal
* ```install scripts```: to install packages I use a lot: vscode, chrome, slack, spotify notion, kicad, fusion 360, gnome tweaks, nano, telegram, arduino IDE, coolterm, armgcc


## Checklist
[] SSH keys for github
[] Toolchains: NRF52 (see IMU wristband repo)
